    overview: `Formerly called the FX, the Infiniti QX70 makes some deliberate sacrifices to be one of the most driver-focused crossovers available.The 2015 Infiniti QX70 isn't a trail-ready or rugged crossover by any stretch of the imagination, and it's not space-efficient either. Instead the QX70 focuses on excellent driving dynamics, handsome looks and its legitimately luxurious interior appointments. At first glance, it's one of the best-executed marriages of sleek lines, wagon practicality, and fast underpinnings we've seen. Where the BMW X6 failed in that mission, the QX70 excels from a design standpoint. Sure, there are a few too many details that might clutter the look from some angles, but it's otherwise excellent–from it's racy roofline to its beautiful sheetmetal. Inside, it's inviting and warm, with rich appointments like quilted leather and subdued wood trim–though there may be a few too many buttons for some shoppers.`,
